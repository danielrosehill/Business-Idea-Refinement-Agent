# Baby QR Onesies

Babies are hard work!

Newborn apps are too, however. 

Nobody has time to track individual feeds etc. 

Here's a solution for over tecched Home Assistant types:

A wearable custom printed baby oneside. 

Concept:

Oneside has QR codes for various things  that people track like:

- Diaper change 
- Bath 
- Breastfeeding

The QR codes link to webhooks. So users just have to point a cam at the right code to log the event in Home Assistant. 

The implementation is a print on demand business called BabyQR.com

Users can either send in their own webhooks to have the oneside printed and delivered (to size). 

or they can pay for a monthly managed servce in which the webhooks and a basic logging interface are provided alongside a phone app ... so users get the hardware and software bundled. The latter is marketed at a less tech savvy demographic. 

Note: the idea is deliberately kind of ridiculous but also has an aspiration to be kind of helpful. It's priced at just about enough to cover costs with a little margin leftover for a side hustle income stream and to maintain the project.
